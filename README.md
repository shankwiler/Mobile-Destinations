# Mobile Destinations

Google Maps is great. On mobile it's missing one important feature -- that is adding multiple destinations to a single route. It's available on desktop, and actually viewable from mobile devices. They just can't build the route themselves. This webpage allows mobile devices to build a route, and then provides a link to Map's route for their multiple destinations.
